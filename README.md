# 🌿 EcoRaiz: The Smart Planting System (Open Source)

**EcoRaiz** is an AI-powered planting system designed to transform dry, barren lands into thriving green forests.  
It combines **machine learning**, **image processing**, and **environmental analysis** to identify fertile zones and recommend long-lifespan tree species that can sustain for **30+ years**.

---

## 🌱 Vision

EcoRaiz aims to make environmental restoration smarter, faster, and more accessible.  
By leveraging technology, we help users — from individual farmers to environmental organizations — understand their land and plant the right trees for the right soil.

> “Let’s make the Earth greener, one intelligent seed at a time.” 🌍

## 🌿 Core Features

### 🧩 **1. Smart Soil Analysis**
- Upload a **photo of soil**.
- AI analyzes and identifies:
  - Soil type (Loam, Clay, Sandy, etc.)
  - Color tone and texture
  - Moisture content
  - pH and fertility index  
- Displays an easy-to-understand report and suggests tree species suitable for that soil type.
- Generates a **PDF report** with soil details and planting recommendations.

---

### 🛰️ **2. Land Zone Analysis (Satellite Mode)**
- Upload a **satellite/top-view image** of your land.
- The image is automatically divided into **9 equal plots (3×3 matrix)**.
- Each plot can be provided with user input like:
  - 🌡️ Temperature  
  - 💧 Humidity  
  - ⚗️ Soil pH  
  - 🌱 Moisture  
- System analyzes which plots are more fertile and ranks them.
- Suggests **tree species with 30+ years of lifespan** based on data.
- Exports a **visualized report** showing the most sustainable planting zones.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload Image** → Soil or Satellite view.  
2. **AI Analysis** → Model processes image & environmental data.  
3. **Visualization** → Divides area, highlights fertile plots.  
4. **Recommendation** → Suggests tree types based on conditions.  
5. **Report Generation** → Produces downloadable PDF summary.
